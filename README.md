# Gametheory 

This project is a showcase for the fashion editorial "Gametheory", with models Aisha & Jaimie styled by Marco Lee. The project is inspired by the prisoner's dilemma - a game theory thought experiment that involves two rational agents, each of whom can cooperate for mutual benefit or betray their partner ("defect") for individual reward[1]. 

In this fashion editorial, user is presented with a form that requests their name and a choice out of two options: (1) Cooperate and (2) Betray. This form could be accessed by hovering / clicking (on mobile device) the bottom drawer. The user choice will affect the image that appears as a result of their action. This current image will be responding to the previous image that is chosen by another user action.
